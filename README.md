✅ TCS SALESFORCE LAST MILE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
SERVICE REQUEST & TICKET TRACKING SYSTEM (CRM)
By Smart CRM Solutions
________________________________________
-----------------------------------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Smart CRM Solutions provides Salesforce platform support to thousands of internal users. Employees frequently raise Salesforce-related issues, enhancements, or access requests. Previously, these requests arrived through emails, phone calls, or were tracked manually in Excel sheets, causing delays, miscommunication, and lack of visibility into ticket progress.
To solve this, we built a custom Salesforce-based Ticket Tracking CRM that allows the System Administrator to log, track, update, and manage every Salesforce-related request in a centralized system. This application enables better organization, improves internal communication, provides visibility into ticket status, and ensures higher efficiency in handling Salesforce tasks.

-----------------------------------------
OBJECTIVES
The primary goals of the Service Request & Ticket Tracking CRM are:
•	To centralize all internal Salesforce support requests in a structured system.
•	To maintain detailed records of requester, department, priority, and ticket metadata.
•	To automate status tracking and improve transparency for internal users.
•	To eliminate dependency on Excel sheets and email-based tracking.
•	To create a scalable foundation for future automations such as notifications, escalations, and approvals.
•	To allow the System Administrator to efficiently manage workload and track time.
